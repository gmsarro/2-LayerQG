# Reproducible Code for "Sarro et al. 2024"

This repository contains the scripts used in the methods section of the paper "Sarro et al. 2024". The scripts are divided into two main categories:

1. **Local Wave Activity and Budget Calculation for a 2-Layer QG Model (with Latent Heating)**
2. **Eddy Growth Rates Calculation for a 2-Layer QG Model**
